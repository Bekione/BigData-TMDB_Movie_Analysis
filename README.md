## Overview

This project involves the analysis of the TMDB 5000 Movie Dataset to gain insights into various aspects of the movie industry. The dataset includes information on movie releases, budgets, genres, crew collaborations, ratings, and revenues.

## Analysis Questions

The project aims to answer the following key questions:

1. **Seasonal Trends:**
   - Are there any seasonal trends in movie releases or box office performance?

2. **Budget and Popularity Thresholds:**
   - Is there a minimum budget threshold for a movie to be considered popular?

3. **Crew Collaboration Impact:**
   - What is the impact of crew collaboration, such as the same director or actors working together in multiple movies?

4. **Rating and Revenue Consistency:**
   - Examine the consistency between a movie's rating and its revenue.

5. **Budget Distribution Across Genres:**
   - How are budgets distributed across different genres?
